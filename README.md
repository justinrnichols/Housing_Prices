## Preface

The ultimate goal of this project is to predict the housing prices of a certain region or state within the United States. The user will be able to enter their income and desired house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and population of the area they are prospecting. The program will run both the KNN and Linear Regression predictive analysis models and output the predicted housing price according to the inputs from the user. The data used within this predictive application contains USA housing data from https://www.kaggle.com/vedavyasv/usa-housing. 


## Problem Definition

The housing market within the United States has drastically changed over the past year and with this, the prices of homes have been on the uptrend. Prospective homebuyers have been left in the dark on current house pricing trends and some have been subjected to overpaying on homes in certain areas. To solve this problem, this housing price predictive model calculates the price of a home in a particular area by allowing homebuyers to input an array of information. By using the KNN and Linear Regression predictive models, this model removes any misinterpretation of housing prices around the country.


## How to Use the Predictive Model

1. Go to Google Colab and upload the Jupyter notebook (i.e. housing_prediction.ipynb). 
2. Click “Runtime” from the navigation bar and hit “Run all” to execute all the cells within the notebook. 
3. The last cell contains a function call to obtain user input. Within this cell, the user will first be asked to input their income along with the house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and the surrounding area’s population of the house they are looking for. 
4. The user can obtain predicted house prices for either the entire U.S., a particular state, or a certain region. 
5. After giving their desired specifications, the program will output the housing price predictions.
